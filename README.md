# chat-web-app

Live version: https://chat.psfoundation.cash

**Notice**: Chat are not yet encrypted, but we are working hard on this.

This web-based chat app is distributed over IPFS, making it very difficult
to censor or block. It will be end-to-end encrypted, allowing members of the
Foundation to communicate securely without any danger of snooping.
While [our Telegram channel](https://t.me/permissionless_software) allows
communication with a more mainstream audience, the web-based chat app is useful
for anyone who needs to communicate privately in real-time. And because it is
delivered through a web browser, any type of device or operating system can
access it.

This app was originally forked from the [gatsby-ipfs-template](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/gatsby-ipfs-template).
